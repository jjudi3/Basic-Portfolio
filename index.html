			<p id="main-bio">
			Hello!  My name is Judi Perez.  I was born and raised in Aiken, South Carolina.
			I received a Business Administartion degree from the University of South Carolina, majoring in Marketing and Management.  From there I worked in Retail for several years until I came to Atlanta. 
			After few years living in Atlanta,  I went back to school at Georgia State.  I received another Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.  But instead of software programming I went in the Networking direction instead.  I have worked at AT&T for several years as a Network Support Manager. I assist techs with provisioning issues on equipment and circuits. I create job aids to assist the techs with the day-to-day operations.
			AT&T is evolving into a software company, where automation, big data, SDN and web applications will play a major role in Operations.  I don't want to be left behind, so here I am attending this certification class.
